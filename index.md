Hi my name is Bishop Meridth.  My motto is "Small But Mighty"

Some changes I would make include:

- Hurricane food drive
- More sports balls
- Plan drive for new library books

Vote for me and we'll make a suggestion box for you to provide your own input

Don't settle for less...vote for Bishop, who is the best.
